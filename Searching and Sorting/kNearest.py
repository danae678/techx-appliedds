""" Given an array of points where points[i] = (xi,yi) represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0,0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš((x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2)).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

You may use the built-in sorted function. """
